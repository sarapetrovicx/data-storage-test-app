# File Manager Test App
File Manager Test App is a Java application that demonstrates how to use the File Manager Specification interface to manage files and directories on a local file system or Google Drive. 
The application includes a main method that instantiates the Local File Manager Implementation and Google Drive File Manager Implementation classes and demonstrates how to use the methods of the interface to perform various file management operations.

This project demonstrates how the File Manager Specification interface can be used in a real-world application to provide a unified interface for managing files and directories on different file systems. 
It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require file management capabilities.
